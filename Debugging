Valgrind:
•	Tool used in C for detecting memory issues such as memory leaks, invalid memory access, or uninitialized memory usage. It does this by monitoring memory allocations/deallocations.
•	Flags:
•	Memory Leak:
o	valgrind –leak-check=yes ./myprogram
•	Detecting Uninitialized Memory:
o	Valgrind -track-origin=yes ./myprogram

GDB:
•	Tool used in C/C++ for detecting what the program is doing at certain points. Includes detecting segmentation faults and other crashes. It also allows you to stop at specific points.
•	Some commands include:
o	(gdb) run; (gdb) quit; (gdb) break 15 #breaks at line 15;

GUI Debugger (Xcode)
•	Tools allowing for debugging and to visually go through the code by adding breakpoints, and inspecting variables. 
•	You can click left of the line to set breakpoints. Meaning the debugger will run up to that line.
•	Step Over/In/Out allows one to execute lines without function calls, call a function, or exit current function.
•	Variables View displays local and global variables

Similarities
•	All programs are used for debugging
•	Provide breakpoints
•	GDB and Xcode allow line by line execution
•	
Differences
•	Valgrind is used for memory debugging and GDB is used to inspect crashes, logic erros, and segmentation faults. Xcode used GUI system for higher level of inspection than GDB.
•	Xcode is beginner friendly while Valgrind and GDB are command line based
